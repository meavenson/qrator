= Installing Qrator =

== What you need to install Qrator ==

Currently, Qrator only runs on Linux or MacOS X.

To install Qrator, you must have:
 # SVN
 # Java 1.6+
 # Apache Maven
 # A running PostgreSQL database
 # A running instance of either Apache Tomcat 6+ or JBoss EAP 6+

== How to build Qrator ==

 # Check out a copy of Qrator through SVN by following the instructions at [https://code.google.com/p/qrator/source/checkout].
 # Create a new Postgres role *_qrator_* using *_createuser_*, with a password of your choosing.
{{{
 createuser -P <password> qrator
}}}
 # Create an empty *_qrator_* database using *_createdb_*.
{{{
 createdb -O qrator qrator
}}}
 # Install either the empty database schema, or the most recent Qrator database dump to your PostgreSQL database.  Both are located in the *_db_* directory. Replace _schema_only.sql_ with _schema_and_data.sql_ if you want to include previously curated structures, annotations, and references.
{{{
 psql -U qrator qrator < db/schema_only.sql
}}}
 # Enter the _qrator_ directory and make sure your user home directory and Maven repository directory are set properly in  *_mvndeps.sh_*.
{{{
cd qrator && less mvndeps.sh
}}}
 # If the settings are correct, run the Maven dependency installation script:
{{{
./mvndeps.sh
}}}
 # Provide your database settings in *_/src/main/resources/config/persist/persist.prop_* (as shown below).  The *_model_* property shouldn't be modified unless you know what you're doing.
{{{
# PostgreSQL
db_driver=org.postgresql.Driver
db_url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/qrator
db_username=
db_password=

model=config/qrator/model.json
}}}
 # Build the project with Maven:
{{{
mvn package
}}}
 # The Qrator WAR file will be located in the newly created *_target_* subdirectory.  You may move the WAR file to either the Tomcat *_webapps_* directory, or to the *_deployments_* directory in JBoss.
